viminit! when you just want all that syntax checking, auto indent, nerdtree, fuzzy search goodness installed on any environment in one command

## Tested on

- OSX Lion/Mavericks
- Freebsd 10

## Installation
```bash
$ curl -Lo- --insecure https://raw.github.com/jeraldrich/viminit/master/viminit.sh | bash

10 seconds and BAM! Done. No babysitting rubygems. It's not going to win any code artshows, but it gets the job done.
