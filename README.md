# viminit
My vim config. This script is dumb, simple, and has no dependencies. Works on linux, freebsd, osx.

Designed to work like a gui editor, but without wasting time moving hand from keyboard to mouse

- standardizes python files to use autoindented pep8 whitespace
- nerdtree (n shows dir tree)
- nerdcommenter (makes mass commenting / uncommenting easier)
- vim-surround (siX surrounds word in X)
- delimitMate (autocomplete parentheses, quotes, ect)
- ctrlp (fuzzy file finder in open dir and children dir similair to atom find)
- vim-flake8 (auto highlight pep8 style guide errors as you code)
- cool underground vim theme - mustang
- ag (faster than grep for recursive file searching)
- coffeescript, ruby syntax / style checkers
